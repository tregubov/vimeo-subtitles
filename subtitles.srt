1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,400
- [Man] Sorry, confirm left side.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,520
Yeah, put me over.

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,860
- [Man] Is he sort of moving towards us?

4
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:06,930
- [Man] Negative, he's speeding.

5
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,200
If you come right, you'll
come over to open ground here,

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,513
you'll see him from this angle.

7
00:00:11,513 --> 00:00:12,870
(helicopter blades whirring)

8
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:13,703
- Okay, cool.

9
00:00:13,703 --> 00:00:15,187
Might find him this way.

10
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,003
- [Man] Could you circle them,

11
00:00:18,003 --> 00:00:18,916
and we'll go higher.

12
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:23,844
- [Man] I can just see his
head through the bush there.

13
00:00:23,844 --> 00:00:26,927
(lighthearted music)

14
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:32,643
- [Narrator] It was believed

15
00:00:32,643 --> 00:00:35,403
that they were a bygone
group of elephants.

16
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,000
Many people didn't realize

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,133
that these elephants actually existed.

18
00:00:42,048 --> 00:00:44,798
(engine revving)

19
00:00:50,044 --> 00:00:51,640
The super tusker is an elephant

20
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,713
that has ivory that reaches the ground.

21
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,630
Those individuals, they are truly

22
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,880
ambassadors in the elephant world.

23
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,163
They have age, they have
respect from other elephants,

24
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,400
they've had to endure
immense, immense challenges

25
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,033
from drought, to poachings.

26
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,780
They've endured shrinking
elephant habitats,

27
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,233
and human greed,

28
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,763
so imagine what a story he could tell.

29
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,403
Tsavo is a big place.

30
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:40,963
It's vast,

31
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:47,250
and I believe it is Kenya's
last true wilderness area

32
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,213
that holds significant wildlife.

33
00:02:02,064 --> 00:02:04,981
(elephant roaring)

34
00:02:05,914 --> 00:02:08,840
(elephants trumpeting)

35
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,123
And then, of course,
there's the big tusker.

36
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,843
There's less than 25 left on the planet.

37
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,410
I mean, can you imagine having

38
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,380
known and experienced
with these elephants,

39
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,883
just the thought that
there would be no more?

40
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:31,293
By and large, it's just live
for today and not tomorrow,

41
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,570
is it's this perpetual
circle of living for now

42
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,693
and not the future.

43
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,900
I truly believe that more
people need to wake up

44
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,800
and understand that actually,

45
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,500
they're being pushed to the brink.

46
00:02:50,697 --> 00:02:53,447
(engine revving)

47
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:00,802
- [Man] Yeah, that's your own boy in there

48
00:03:00,802 --> 00:03:02,690
just on my left, that's the guy.

49
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,773
- [Man] Okay, alright, we'll do this.

50
00:03:10,237 --> 00:03:12,651
Is (mumbling) there?

51
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,070
- [Man] I haven't seen him yet.

52
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,660
- [Narrator] I think there are ways

53
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,060
that coexistence between humans

54
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,668
and wildlife can work in certain aspects.

55
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:24,140
(speaking foreign language)

56
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,640
But many of the local people

57
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,890
in the communities that we support,

58
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:28,723
they're thinking about

59
00:03:28,723 --> 00:03:30,758
where their next meal is gonna come from.

60
00:03:30,758 --> 00:03:33,341
(gentle music)

61
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,170
But you can change that mindset

62
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,570
that an elephant is a bad thing.

63
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,310
It's a crop raider, it's
killed family members,

64
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,050
it's a hard thing to change

65
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,570
and it's a long process,

66
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:46,970
but I believe it's possible.

67
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,530
If you have space available,

68
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,730
there is a chance that wildlife

69
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,593
and humans can coexist.

70
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,250
Because if you've go the space

71
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,810
and you've got the habitat,

72
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,040
just give it time, give it commitment,

73
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,890
and everything else falls into place.

74
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:10,500
(speaking foreign language)

75
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,750
Searching for those
tuskers on a regular basis,

76
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,800
you're providing an extra
layer of security for them,

77
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,543
eyes in the skies, and eyes
and ears on the ground.

78
00:04:22,445 --> 00:04:23,600
(whistling)

79
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,130
The hope is that with
that security and presence

80
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,983
they will pull through
the next five or 10 years.

81
00:04:58,718 --> 00:05:01,950
In this mad world that we live in,

82
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,830
the fact that there are elephants in Tsavo

83
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,240
that are reaching their full lifespan

84
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,690
and they're dying of old age,

85
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,403
just that in itself is a huge positive.
